This project contains a HTML file of the Jupyter Notebook which can be opened on any browser. </br>

Project background: </br>
  
    Kickstarter (www.kickstarter.com (Links to an external site.)) has established itself as the leading platform for funding 
    creative ventures. Aspiring entrepreneurs in the arts can initiate fundraising campaigns on Kickstarter to support their 
    projects. Some projects have been hugely successful, whereas many others have fallen well short of their fundraising objectives. 
    The attached data filePreview the document contains sample data on over 4000 Kickstarter fundraising campaigns. Each row contains 
    a summary of each campaign, including the goal and amount pledged, the state of the project (e.g., successful, failed), the category 
    of the project (i.e., type of art), and whether the project was featured via a staff pick or spotlight (i.e., on the Kickstarter home page). 
    
Project Steps: </br>

    Step 1: Descriptive statistics such as Total number of projects, Amount pledged: minimum, mean, standard deviation, 
    and maximum Proportion (or percentage) of projects that earned total pledges of at least $1,000 
    Step 2: Identify which project category is the most and least popular (in terms of the number of projects) 
    Step 3: Identify which project category is the most and least successful (on average)
    Step 4: Identify which feature (staff pick or spotlight) is associated with a higher proportion of successful projects
